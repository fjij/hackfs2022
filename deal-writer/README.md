# Deals Writer

Dapp that enables the manual drafting of deals. Each deal is represented by a
JSON file saved to IPFS. To get others to sign your deal, share the link (which
has a CID in the path). After they have signed your deal, they can send their
new link to others to sign and eventually submit.
